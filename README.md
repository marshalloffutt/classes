# classes

These are my solutions for the Try It Yourself exercises in chapter 9 of [Python Crash Course](https://nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse/) by Eric Matthes.

This chapter was an introduction to classes. We learned all the parts to create a class (constructor, attributes, and methods), and learned how to instantiate them and call those methods. We also cover inheritance, and imports for modular-based code.
